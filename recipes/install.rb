## Cookbook Name:: deploy-drupal
## Recipe:: install
##
## make sure drupal is connected to database
##  1. drush si (if not connected and empty db)
##  2. load db from dump (if db empty)
##  3. run post-install script
##  4. fix file permissions
##  5. clear drush cache

   # assemble all necessary query strings and paths
# requires drush 6
